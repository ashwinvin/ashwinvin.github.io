When was the last time you sat down to plan for starting a new activity? Were you able to 
follow it through or even start? You would probably have a quite a lot of reasons, still I
would urge you to reflect on the thoughts you had when dropped the idea from your mind.

We meticulously scheme to have a perfect start, to achieve quicker, faster and stand out 
from where we fit in. Nevertheless, how shall we reach where we ought to, if we never 
started?

Men often set down detailed plans or roadmaps to reach their goal. However, we often
get stuck being in the motion rather than doing the action. The urge to execute our 
actions flawlessly consumes our will to fail. By fearing to fail we inevitably fear to even 
attempt, and consequently we look for easier alternatives. Undoubtedly starting a vicious 
cycle to never take the first step.

Perfectionism barely matters in the first few baby steps. Achieving excellence is more in 
the realm of being consistent as opposed to having a foresight. For instance, MNC's 
make prototypes and minimum viable products to gather insights, then rapidly test 
variations before settling on to the "near-perfect" product. In the age of information, we 
are simply few strokes away from any knowledge. It's upto us to begin with what we have 
and to trust ourselves. Overtime we'll gain necessary skills to refine and reach where we 
started for .

The next time you doubt yourself, take the leap of faith, trust your intuitions and with time everything shall fall into place.
